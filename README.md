This repo contains some sample programs on post processing of onboard carbody floor accelerations to calculate spectrogram and ride comfort index. Ride comfort indices are calculated using EN12999 standard and sperling index calculation procedures. Ride comfort calculation module is adopted from github repo compfy and modified to introduce capability of tracibility (location,time, coach travel direction, track section in swedish network and coach ID tracibility).
